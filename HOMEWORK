HOMEWORK

  1. Add another penguin to the zoo by adding an entry to the penguin array.
     Note: Adding it here should make the new penguin appear in the console
     output with out modification to the main function of Zoo.

  2. When a penguin eats a fish, the full weight of the fish should not be
     added to the weight of the penguin (current behavior). Instead add 3/4
     of the weight of the fish to the penguin's weight.

  3. When a penguin swims, it loses five pounds. Update the class to reflect
     this behavior.

  4. A penguin dies when it weighs 0 pounds. Add a function to check the weight
     before a penguin swims. Add a way to track if a penguin is dead.

  5. Add an aquarium to hold fish.

  6. Add three fish to the aquarium.

  7. Add the aquarium to the zoo and add print statements to describe it.
